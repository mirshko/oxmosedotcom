**Ordering options**

We solely accept orders for music products through our secure online store. We are not proposing orders by e-mail or via phone. However, if you still require additional information about our products prior to making a purchase, feel free to contact us.

**Checkout process issues**

If you are encountering problems while shopping, it could be due to a few reasons. Firstly, if you are ordering from a firewalled company network or a non-standard PC/Mac unit (such as a games console), the shopping cart may not function properly. To avoid this issue, we suggest using a regular stand-alone PC/Mac or mobile whenever possible. Another cause of problems could be due to the security settings on your web browser being set too high, which can prevent your computer from communicating with our server. If you are using Internet Explorer, try adjusting the security level slider to a medium setting. For other browsers, ensure that « Java », « JavaScript », and « Cookies » are enabled in the browser settings. If the issue persists, please don’t hesitate to contact us for assistance.
